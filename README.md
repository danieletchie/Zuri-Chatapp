## How it works
1. Visit the Chat app url and you will land on the homepage where you are asked to type a chat room you like to enter
2. Type anything in the input field and click enter to procceede to the Chat Room
3. All uses no the same chat room and send and recieve messages. You have to be in thesame chat room to send and receive messages with someone
4. Chat room messages are stored uniquely so in order to see your chat history you must enter the same chat room you had that interaction. i.e If you enter a chat room named "Zuri" and sends messages there, when you come back to the Chatapp if you decide to use another chat room "I4G" you won't see your chat history from the Zuri Chat room appearing in anyother chat room.
